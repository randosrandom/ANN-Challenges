# ANN-Challenges
Challenges done for the "Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning" course at Politecnico di Milano

## Homework1
FACE MASK DETECTION USING A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK: created a CNN, using Keras API, that classifies images depicting groups of people based on the number of masked people.

## Homework2
CROP SEGMENTATION USING A FULLY CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK: Created a F-CNN, using Keras API, that taking as input an RGB image of a crop produces a segmented mask of the image, distinguishing between crop, weeds and background.

## Homework3
VISUAL QUESTION ANSWERING: created a VQA model, combining a convolutional neural network (VGG16) and a recurrent neural network (based on LSTMs), that given as input an image representing a synthetic scene and a corresponding question, provide a closed-ended answer.
